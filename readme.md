I am going to speak about new approaches and new tools in the RSS' education process. A repository consists of some materials I will talk about.

Currently I am developing a tool called CSSLab (stands for CSS laboratory). Its goal is to investigate a site's CSS styles interactively. 

The websites' files can be stored locally or in a Github repository.

Probably CSSLab will useful for mentors also because it will show a version of CSS properties the site created with.

Hope I will deliver it on-time! ;-)

I would also like to say about grabbers I created during the studying in RSS. They allow me to save time significantly for becoming a some sort of proficiency in JS. First of all I mean the Ilya Kantor's website code grabber which downloaded all the code for chapters and generated a '4-level' table of contents.


Stay tuned!
